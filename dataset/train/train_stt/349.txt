[31.54s -> 49.26s]  Hello dear friends, every time when I go up on this stage, I feel some, to be honest,
[49.26s -> 53.82s]  special excitement, because my guests are people from a different generation, I have always
[53.82s -> 58.22s]  been sure that I have something to teach them, and now I am more and more convinced of the
[58.22s -> 65.26s]  opposite, they have something to teach me, and I am always in anticipation, because here we get to know
[65.26s -> 73.10s]  great musicians, we understand each other in modern art, and we have a lot of fun together
[73.10s -> 85.62s]  and alone, so let's go! With you all evening today I will be Vlad Malenko, and if you are
[85.62s -> 92.06s]  tired of looking at me and you want beauty and aesthetics, then here she is in our bar,
[92.06s -> 97.98s]  Olichka, beauty will save the world, as Fedor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky said in one of his works,
[97.98s -> 105.42s]  and Olya is our personal M.C.S. in beauty, you know, like a savior on the beach, all the time sitting somewhere
[105.42s -> 129.98s]  Olya, then please decide that it is time to announce the topic of today's issue,
[129.98s -> 137.34s]  or we will still talk? Announce Vlad, I allow. There is, yes, and so today we are discussing an amazing
[137.34s -> 144.54s]  phenomenon, large-scale, bright, which reaches, guys, to those people who are even trying to
[144.54s -> 153.34s]  bypass theaters, museums, and this phenomenon is called street art, street art is our today's
[153.34s -> 163.74s]  topic. Yes, who of us was not a street art artist? Well, I too, of course, and I often wrote
[163.74s -> 169.78s]  big beautiful three letters on the fences, I, of course, about the world and May, but I am sure that in the hall
[169.78s -> 174.46s]  there are people who understand street art much better than me, this is one hundred percent, so I want to
[174.46s -> 181.86s]  invite now to the stage the founder of the international biennale of street art, art
[181.86s -> 202.90s]  atmosphere, Stabina Chagina, Stabina, I am very glad to see you, I am glad to see you. Before we start our, I hope, very
[202.90s -> 207.78s]  interesting conversation, I would like to draw everyone's attention to us on the screen. Here are two
[207.78s -> 216.74s]  interesting photographs that were taken in Europe, they are Felicia Varini, hands and work, ancient
[216.74s -> 224.42s]  medieval castles, the question is what we already see in front of ourselves the creation of amazing
[224.42s -> 231.38s]  sculptures, and we can probably admire these buildings without this imagination of a modern artist,
[231.38s -> 239.98s]  is this vandalism, how much is this permission here, Sabin, possible? Felicia Varini is generally a
[239.98s -> 246.46s]  unique artist, because he is just very soft and smoothly integrated into this story,
[246.46s -> 256.42s]  due to his anamorphic works, which are gathered in one place, in a certain place, that is, you need to look at them from a certain point,
[256.42s -> 262.26s]  and this is already now an object of pride, there are countries, there is art, groups are gathered,
[262.26s -> 269.06s]  tourist groups, I understand, they are called to a certain point, yes, that is, this is such a dialogue of today,
[269.06s -> 274.38s]  modern art, listen, but there has always been modern art, well, in short, if you are Pythagoras,
[274.38s -> 282.06s]  and I am Socrates, does anyone give us the right to go and draw their formulas on the pyramids erected there,
[282.06s -> 287.50s]  maybe even genius? Well, in fact, this is a great artist, I don't think that he just took it without a right,
[287.50s -> 295.10s]  and here he came and got drunk, this work has passed some level of approval, including, perhaps,
[295.10s -> 301.78s]  an order came directly from the institution itself, where it is depicted, this is not an introduction,
[302.14s -> 309.54s]  not some kind of intervention by an artist, although this is also the case, and there is a clear definition that this is street art,
[309.54s -> 318.98s]  and this is vandalism, well, of course, there is, what is it, where are the criteria, you need expertise for this, you need to understand,
[318.98s -> 327.26s]  you need to look at everything, you know, you can also find some talented unknown musicians in music,
[327.26s -> 332.78s]  and absolutely talentless, who, I don't know, open their mouths under the plywood, that is,
[332.78s -> 341.26s]  here in art the same thing, there are secondary works, well, we all, I think, know a well-known
[341.26s -> 348.34s]  character named Banksy, and very often they argue whether it is vandalism, but at the same time Banksy's works
[348.34s -> 354.50s]  are sold for millions of pounds at auctions, and they are mainly bought, this is such, well,
[354.50s -> 360.98s]  partly absurd, which is created around street art, but we are already used to it,
[360.98s -> 367.58s]  well, still, look at the music, we can already press the button with you and choose Shostakovich or Sausage,
[367.58s -> 373.62s]  if we can, if we did not come to a restaurant and just want to eat food and not hear what it turns on,
[373.62s -> 380.42s]  and here they impose on us, well, listen, they impose on us advertising, this is exactly what they impose on us,
[380.42s -> 384.42s]  yes, that is, you go out into the street and they show you some kind of advertising, they say that you
[384.42s -> 390.02s]  have to buy this thing, I don't think that if the artist exposes himself on the street, then he
[390.02s -> 397.34s]  imposes something on someone, and the city is, in fact, a public space that belongs to everyone,
[397.34s -> 402.62s]  as in a house, you know, there is an entrance, it belongs to all the owners of the house, the same thing, it seems to me
[402.62s -> 408.38s]  that the more there will be some kind of creativity from the citizens of the city who will treat the city
[408.38s -> 417.86s]  as a house, then on the contrary it will be better, the question is that if in some way it interferes with someone,
[417.86s -> 423.90s]  but you can always organize, for example, make such a space in the city, give it to the artist,
[423.90s -> 429.26s]  and say, please, create here, yes, but there are such examples, you know, there in New York, Five Points,
[429.26s -> 436.30s]  where the artists just created, created, created, there was a huge amount of graffiti on the house,
[436.30s -> 441.78s]  and then when a new owner came to the house, he just painted it because he wanted to make repairs,
[441.78s -> 448.94s]  it turned out that it turned out that it was very important for everyone to return this graffiti, moreover, the artists won the court,
[448.94s -> 457.14s]  there is such a thin line here, what is your main task in the artistic world right now,
[457.14s -> 464.42s]  and I, as a rule, here I also thought for a long time, well, in addition to studying this research, it is simply interesting for me to
[464.54s -> 471.62s]  analyze what is happening, see how many questions I have, so many questions, maybe even more,
[471.62s -> 481.70s]  this is a very interesting, this is a living topic, a phenomenon, and this is absolutely, well, in fact, an actual, actual phenomenon today,
[481.70s -> 486.90s]  maybe even the most relevant in the field of art, I agree, I agree, because it is daily, you came there,
[486.90s -> 494.10s]  something appeared on the street, and then you came and there was no such thing, so here I am, probably, if you think about what I'm doing right now,
[494.10s -> 504.86s]  I probably defend the rights of artists, well, I don't even defend them, but I protect them, well, that is, I convey the idea of the artist,
[504.86s -> 512.94s]  who, as a rule, does not really like to speak and convey his idea, he is the creator of a visual image that may be incomprehensible to someone,
[512.94s -> 514.94s]  and can you give examples?
[514.94s -> 520.54s]  Yes, there is an interesting example, maybe you remember, there was such a job on the street,
[520.54s -> 527.26s]  there was a boy, he swam on a fish and played on a fishing rod, right on the third ring,
[527.26s -> 534.22s]  yes, yes, yes, unfortunately, it was painted, this is the work of Rustam Akubik, his first work, Rustam is now a super star,
[534.22s -> 539.82s]  famous all over the world, it seems to me that there is no such country where Rustam would not have done his job,
[539.82s -> 545.82s]  this work, it should have appeared, in fact, in Orlikov's alley, and there, I don't remember who it was,
[546.30s -> 553.66s]  either the deputy head of management or someone like that from the owners, who said that this boy,
[553.66s -> 559.10s]  he is, in general, some kind of drunkard, and therefore he turned out to be under water, so he swam on a fish,
[559.10s -> 567.10s]  well, that is, in general, absolute nonsense, in my opinion, but the work was not allowed to be done in the place where it should have been,
[567.66s -> 576.14s]  and we first tried to explain that the boy plays on a flute, that he has such a underwater journey,
[576.14s -> 580.38s]  that this is such a beautiful underwater world, and then they just made it in another place,
[582.62s -> 590.78s]  this is also such a part of the struggle, but now in life there was a find of such a level,
[591.02s -> 601.02s]  I don't know, the golden mask of Tutankhamun, in the sense of the presence of some person who sat quietly in Khoruschevka
[601.02s -> 607.02s]  and turned out to be a genius, a madilyan, and suddenly you found it, did you make such a person?
[607.02s -> 617.02s]  I remember that one day I found such an artist on Behance, Ivan Nainty, who, in general, is now exhibited in galleries,
[617.50s -> 624.30s]  I remember how I signed up with him and offered him to do something, he had not done anything on the street yet,
[624.30s -> 630.30s]  he did not make a large format, and I constantly offered him to increase this format,
[630.30s -> 638.30s]  I also remember how our cooperation with such an artist as Dmitryaski began, and Dima stopped doing the Code Red project,
[638.30s -> 644.30s]  it was such a website about street art, he was the editor of this site, a designer, and so on,
[644.38s -> 652.38s]  and in general, we began to go out to the city and exhibitions with him, I was the curator of his first exhibition together with Alexey Lukoyn.
[652.38s -> 658.38s]  How did you manage to make a canvas at the Leningrad station with Dmitry Ivansky, a strategic object,
[658.38s -> 662.38s]  you won't get through it with a violin, you won't get through it, and here...
[662.38s -> 668.38s]  Yes, I also have good news, still, the management of the RZD decided to leave this work,
[668.46s -> 676.46s]  it was done temporarily, but now the decision has been made that it will remain, and this is, of course, a revolution,
[676.46s -> 682.46s]  there was a request that I wanted to do something, that modern art should be integrated,
[682.46s -> 688.46s]  it was some kind of anniversary date of Sapsan, a message between St. Petersburg and Moscow,
[688.46s -> 696.46s]  our project was called the art of communication, and if you look at this work, you can see the connection of these two cities,
[696.54s -> 702.54s]  Sapsan has somehow incorporated his work into the architecture, into the context, into the history,
[702.54s -> 704.54s]  that's probably why it remained.
[704.54s -> 710.54s]  Sabina, I have the impression that the artists agree with the housing services
[710.54s -> 714.54s]  so that you paint them, so that they can squeeze it a little,
[714.54s -> 718.54s]  and then there will be an opportunity to tell something about it, because, well, this is how he draws,
[718.54s -> 722.54s]  well, nobody needs it, especially if he is, well, let's say, not Rodchenko.
[722.54s -> 723.54s]  There is a lot of speculation.
[723.54s -> 724.54s]  Or adventurism.
[724.62s -> 728.62s]  Even Banks was accused, Banks was also accused of speculation,
[728.62s -> 736.62s]  because he, of course, raises such speculative topics, and they are, of course, very popular.
[736.62s -> 743.62s]  To be honest, I don't really like such speculative statements,
[743.62s -> 748.62s]  because it seems to me that the path of the artist is such a marathon,
[748.70s -> 754.70s]  he is long, long, and he is thoughtful, first of all.
[754.70s -> 761.70s]  And to turn your work into a news tape, into some kind of road patrol,
[761.70s -> 764.70s]  where you reflect on any news.
[764.70s -> 766.70s]  Golden words, Sabina says.
[766.70s -> 770.70s]  Art is deeper, it is deeper than the tape.
[770.70s -> 772.70s]  Well, then you have to live for a long time.
[772.70s -> 776.70s]  Well, you can live consciously.
[776.78s -> 781.78s]  And then this tape, it is perceived as a tape,
[781.78s -> 783.78s]  that is, what comes and goes.
[783.78s -> 788.78s]  But there are some unimaginable things that they will always eat.
[788.78s -> 791.78s]  This is where the art of the present is located.
[791.78s -> 793.78s]  Thank you very much for this conversation.
[793.78s -> 797.78s]  It is interesting and it seems that it requires a continuation,
[797.78s -> 805.78s]  and I would like, maybe, a few more programs later to talk and return to this topic.
[805.86s -> 806.86s]  Thank you very much.
[806.86s -> 807.86s]  Thank you very much.
[807.86s -> 810.86s]  We invite you to our Olya's bar.
[810.86s -> 811.86s]  Thank you.
[811.86s -> 813.86s]  To our Olya.
[813.86s -> 816.86s]  Friends, since we understand street art here,
[816.86s -> 822.86s]  then God himself ordered to invite one of the artists and creators,
[822.86s -> 824.86s]  a man, here, to our art yard,
[824.86s -> 826.86s]  who walks down the streets with a balloon,
[826.86s -> 829.86s]  but not because he is afraid that hooligans will attack him,
[829.86s -> 832.86s]  but because inspiration can attack him.
[832.94s -> 835.94s]  A man who climbs the wall not out of boredom,
[835.94s -> 837.94s]  but to paint this wall.
[837.94s -> 840.94s]  Let's meet him with loud applause.
[840.94s -> 842.94s]  Nikita Nummers.
[842.94s -> 844.94s]  Nikita, hello.
[844.94s -> 898.17s]  Please.
[898.17s -> 901.17s]  Nikita, how did it all start?
[901.17s -> 904.17s]  I understand that at first,
[904.17s -> 907.17s]  a person draws a hand in school,
[907.17s -> 909.17s]  like Albert, right?
[909.17s -> 912.17s]  Well, all the same, and Sazov began.
[912.25s -> 915.25s]  Yes, everything began in school,
[915.25s -> 919.25s]  mainly then I was probably involved in hip-hop culture,
[919.25s -> 923.25s]  which was just gaining popularity in the country.
[923.25s -> 925.25s]  The visual part of hip-hop culture was graffiti,
[925.25s -> 928.25s]  what I saw on the streets, what I saw in the clips.
[928.25s -> 931.25s]  But everything began with subculture,
[931.25s -> 933.25s]  that is, we gathered with friends,
[933.25s -> 936.25s]  we had graffiti teams,
[936.25s -> 938.25s]  we made some collective walls,
[938.25s -> 940.25s]  they were quite simple.
[940.33s -> 943.33s]  But even at that time I was more responsible for the characters,
[943.33s -> 945.33s]  because graffiti is first of all letters,
[945.33s -> 948.33s]  writing your nickname, the name of the team.
[948.33s -> 950.33s]  And I make characters,
[950.33s -> 952.33s]  they were quite simple, comic, cartoonish,
[952.33s -> 955.33s]  which were in line with the patterns of my friends.
[955.33s -> 958.33s]  Can you make money today as a street artist?
[958.33s -> 960.33s]  Or do you still require a combination?
[960.33s -> 962.33s]  In my understanding, street art,
[962.33s -> 964.33s]  in its purest form,
[964.33s -> 966.33s]  is a partisan activity,
[966.33s -> 969.33s]  when an artist, regardless of the festival,
[969.41s -> 971.41s]  goes out into the city,
[971.41s -> 973.41s]  agrees first of all with himself,
[973.41s -> 975.41s]  the choice of themes, the choice of locations,
[975.41s -> 977.41s]  creates work.
[977.41s -> 980.41s]  Naturally, on this you do not earn money.
[980.41s -> 982.41s]  I wanted to ask,
[982.41s -> 985.41s]  how does the idea arise,
[985.41s -> 988.41s]  that is, this study of the genius of the place,
[988.41s -> 990.41s]  how long,
[990.41s -> 993.41s]  as the schoolgirls come to the crime scene,
[993.41s -> 995.41s]  how long does the artist come,
[995.41s -> 997.41s]  but in your case,
[997.49s -> 999.49s]  why do you go from this side and look?
[999.49s -> 1001.49s]  There is a grocery store,
[1001.49s -> 1003.49s]  here he climbed on the roof.
[1003.49s -> 1005.49s]  I understand, yes,
[1005.49s -> 1007.49s]  to look at some apartment.
[1007.49s -> 1009.49s]  But now it is so diverse,
[1009.49s -> 1012.49s]  and street art exists in the format of a festival,
[1012.49s -> 1014.49s]  where there are agreements,
[1014.49s -> 1016.49s]  legal, long processes.
[1016.49s -> 1018.49s]  Sabina told how hard it is
[1018.49s -> 1020.49s]  to agree on some large creations,
[1020.49s -> 1022.49s]  paintings of larger objects.
[1022.49s -> 1025.49s]  And of course, large objects are created,
[1025.57s -> 1027.57s]  so sketches are prepared for a long time,
[1027.57s -> 1029.57s]  prepared for a specific place,
[1029.57s -> 1032.57s]  and this is often done at festivals,
[1032.57s -> 1034.57s]  and sometimes it is in other cities.
[1034.57s -> 1036.57s]  You will see this place,
[1036.57s -> 1038.57s]  perhaps, only on arrival,
[1038.57s -> 1040.57s]  and you can only focus on photos,
[1040.57s -> 1042.57s]  on video,
[1042.57s -> 1044.57s]  and prepare your model,
[1044.57s -> 1046.57s]  and only on arrival you fully immerse yourself in this place.
[1046.57s -> 1048.57s]  Therefore, the specifics of the approach are different,
[1048.57s -> 1050.57s]  because I participate in festivals
[1050.57s -> 1052.57s]  and legal projects,
[1052.57s -> 1054.57s]  and I do the project in a partisan way.
[1054.65s -> 1056.65s]  Therefore, probably,
[1056.65s -> 1058.65s]  partisan projects,
[1058.65s -> 1060.65s]  illegal, self-reliant,
[1060.65s -> 1062.65s]  they are probably born
[1062.65s -> 1064.65s]  from the place.
[1064.65s -> 1066.65s]  There is probably more freedom here
[1066.65s -> 1068.65s]  than at festivals,
[1068.65s -> 1070.65s]  because at festivals there is always a little more responsibility.
[1070.65s -> 1072.65s]  Responsibility is not only on you,
[1072.65s -> 1074.65s]  on organizers, on curators.
[1074.65s -> 1076.65s]  And realizing this,
[1076.65s -> 1078.65s]  you keep yourself in tune.
[1078.65s -> 1080.65s]  By the way, about the place,
[1080.65s -> 1082.65s]  which is called a place,
[1082.73s -> 1084.73s]  only such a creative work,
[1084.73s -> 1086.73s]  do you want to be an organizer?
[1086.73s -> 1088.73s]  Does this conflict interfere with you?
[1088.73s -> 1090.73s]  Or, on the contrary, does it help?
[1090.73s -> 1092.73s]  For me,
[1092.73s -> 1094.73s]  it helped me to understand
[1094.73s -> 1096.73s]  many other organizers,
[1096.73s -> 1098.73s]  curators,
[1098.73s -> 1100.73s]  and artists themselves.
[1100.73s -> 1102.73s]  But the thing is that when an artist
[1102.73s -> 1104.73s]  does not encounter any organizational projects
[1104.73s -> 1106.73s]  or processes at all,
[1106.73s -> 1108.73s]  he often does not understand
[1108.73s -> 1110.73s]  all these difficulties.
[1110.81s -> 1112.81s]  In both countries,
[1112.81s -> 1114.81s]  and even now on the slide
[1114.81s -> 1116.81s]  of work from the Arab Emirates,
[1116.81s -> 1118.81s]  there was a big festival in Dubai,
[1118.81s -> 1120.81s]  and everything seems to be very high organized.
[1120.81s -> 1122.81s]  But in fact,
[1122.81s -> 1124.81s]  firstly,
[1124.81s -> 1126.81s]  there is no street art,
[1126.81s -> 1128.81s]  because there are
[1128.81s -> 1130.81s]  public art legal projects,
[1130.81s -> 1132.81s]  but there is no low activity,
[1132.81s -> 1134.81s]  because the law is strict,
[1134.81s -> 1136.81s]  no one allows themselves to do extra.
[1136.81s -> 1138.81s]  The city itself seemed to me
[1138.89s -> 1140.89s]  to be so boring,
[1140.89s -> 1142.89s]  not alive,
[1142.89s -> 1144.89s]  and even when the organization
[1144.89s -> 1146.89s]  seems to be very high,
[1146.89s -> 1148.89s]  but there is no life either.
[1148.89s -> 1150.89s]  There is a festival
[1150.89s -> 1152.89s]  in Yekaterinburg,
[1152.89s -> 1154.89s]  it is completely organized by artists,
[1154.89s -> 1156.89s]  it is a partisan festival
[1156.89s -> 1158.89s]  organized by artists themselves.
[1158.89s -> 1160.89s]  And it is so lively
[1160.89s -> 1162.89s]  when you are part of this community,
[1162.89s -> 1164.89s]  when you communicate
[1164.89s -> 1166.89s]  and come up with all this.
[1166.97s -> 1168.97s]  Maybe everything is quite simple
[1168.97s -> 1170.97s]  in terms of some,
[1170.97s -> 1172.97s]  well, if we talk about organizational moments,
[1172.97s -> 1174.97s]  everyday life and so on,
[1174.97s -> 1176.97s]  but it is somehow lively
[1176.97s -> 1178.97s]  and at home,
[1178.97s -> 1180.97s]  rather than when you come
[1180.97s -> 1182.97s]  and there are a hundred volunteers
[1182.97s -> 1184.97s]  around you,
[1184.97s -> 1186.97s]  and lunch is brought on the tray.
[1186.97s -> 1188.97s]  What inspires you?
[1188.97s -> 1190.97s]  I am always interested
[1190.97s -> 1192.97s]  in stories when
[1192.97s -> 1194.97s]  an artist can be inspired by
[1195.05s -> 1197.05s]  an artist, a writer, a poet,
[1197.05s -> 1199.05s]  and so on.
[1199.05s -> 1201.05s]  Each work and project
[1201.05s -> 1203.05s]  can probably be told separately,
[1203.05s -> 1205.05s]  sometimes a life situation,
[1205.05s -> 1207.05s]  sometimes something else.
[1207.05s -> 1209.05s]  In the days,
[1209.05s -> 1211.05s]  we had such a joint,
[1211.05s -> 1213.05s]  well, not a joint release,
[1213.05s -> 1215.05s]  but a release of the Krak group,
[1215.05s -> 1217.05s]  this is a famous St. Petersburg
[1217.05s -> 1219.05s]  rap group,
[1219.05s -> 1221.05s]  which I have been listening to
[1221.05s -> 1223.05s]  since school days,
[1223.13s -> 1225.13s]  and the composer of the group,
[1225.13s -> 1227.13s]  Fuse, offered to make a cover,
[1227.13s -> 1229.13s]  he had a release album on the days,
[1229.13s -> 1231.13s]  and I did it in the format
[1231.13s -> 1233.13s]  of a wooden panel in the workshop,
[1233.13s -> 1235.13s]  which has already developed
[1235.13s -> 1237.13s]  in the format of a cover.
[1237.13s -> 1239.13s]  For me, this is a very interesting
[1239.13s -> 1241.13s]  and pleasant experience,
[1241.13s -> 1243.13s]  because this is just an example
[1243.13s -> 1245.13s]  of what I listened to since school
[1245.13s -> 1247.13s]  and continue to listen to.
[1247.13s -> 1249.13s]  They came up with a certain order?
[1249.13s -> 1251.13s]  Yes, they offered,
[1251.21s -> 1253.21s]  and this is a work of St. Petersburg graffiti,
[1253.21s -> 1255.21s]  so it continues to follow
[1255.21s -> 1257.21s]  the artists in general.
[1257.21s -> 1259.21s]  I'm talking to you,
[1259.21s -> 1261.21s]  I understand that you are a living modern artist,
[1261.21s -> 1263.21s]  now I'm asking you what you are now
[1263.21s -> 1265.21s]  working on at this time,
[1265.21s -> 1267.21s]  when we met.
[1267.21s -> 1269.21s]  After all, I want to make such a conclusion
[1269.21s -> 1271.21s]  that how interesting it is to look
[1271.21s -> 1273.21s]  at the clouds or at the sea.
[1273.21s -> 1275.21s]  This is the best street art
[1275.21s -> 1277.21s]  that I have seen,
[1277.21s -> 1279.21s]  and there will be no all of us,
[1279.29s -> 1281.29s]  and this is brilliant.
[1281.29s -> 1283.29s]  This is brilliant,
[1283.29s -> 1285.29s]  this is incomparable with Banksy,
[1285.29s -> 1287.29s]  Michelangelo, Leonardo,
[1287.29s -> 1289.29s]  God, not with me,
[1289.29s -> 1291.29s]  not with anyone.
[1291.29s -> 1293.29s]  So what are you working on now?
[1293.29s -> 1295.29s]  I'm not working on what,
[1295.29s -> 1297.29s]  I'm just continuing the same idea
[1297.29s -> 1299.29s]  that everything is changing
[1299.29s -> 1301.29s]  for the sake of natural phenomena,
[1301.29s -> 1303.29s]  if you look.
[1303.29s -> 1305.29s]  In fact, street art is also
[1305.29s -> 1307.29s]  what I like about it,
[1307.37s -> 1309.37s]  when you do a job,
[1309.37s -> 1311.37s]  it remains in the city
[1311.37s -> 1313.37s]  and lives its life,
[1313.37s -> 1315.37s]  it can be painted,
[1315.37s -> 1317.37s]  it can be spoiled,
[1317.37s -> 1319.37s]  it is complemented by other artists,
[1319.37s -> 1321.37s]  it always changes due to weather conditions.
[1321.37s -> 1323.37s]  In your work, there are quite a lot of co-partners
[1323.37s -> 1325.37s]  who appear over time.
[1325.37s -> 1327.37s]  As for the question
[1327.37s -> 1329.37s]  what I'm doing now,
[1329.37s -> 1331.37s]  now is the winter period,
[1331.37s -> 1333.37s]  in Russia for many street artists
[1333.37s -> 1335.37s]  this is naturally such a period
[1335.45s -> 1337.45s]  of work in workshops or something else.
[1337.45s -> 1339.45s]  We are now making
[1339.45s -> 1341.45s]  printed publications
[1341.45s -> 1343.45s]  about the street art of Nizhniy Novgorod,
[1343.45s -> 1345.45s]  soon I think we will be able to present it.
[1345.45s -> 1347.45s]  And what will it be called?
[1347.45s -> 1349.45s]  It will be an encyclopedia
[1349.45s -> 1351.45s]  of the street art of Nizhniy Novgorod.
[1351.45s -> 1353.45s]  That is, there is an encyclopedic format,
[1353.45s -> 1355.45s]  a large chronological article,
[1355.45s -> 1357.45s]  biographical references.
[1357.45s -> 1359.45s]  By the way, there will be
[1359.45s -> 1361.45s]  a separate map with routes
[1361.45s -> 1363.45s]  that allow you to walk
[1363.53s -> 1365.53s]  through the streets of Nizhniy Novgorod
[1365.53s -> 1367.53s]  by finding various objects,
[1367.53s -> 1369.53s]  both partisan and objects
[1369.53s -> 1371.53s]  made within various festivals.
[1371.53s -> 1373.53s]  With the help of this building,
[1373.53s -> 1375.53s]  people will be able to immerse themselves
[1375.53s -> 1377.53s]  in the street art of my hometown.
[1377.53s -> 1379.53s]  Thank you very much for this conversation.
[1379.53s -> 1381.53s]  After all, it was not just interesting
[1381.53s -> 1383.53s]  but also serious.
[1383.53s -> 1385.53s]  And after it, we decided
[1385.53s -> 1387.53s]  to offer such a game,
[1387.53s -> 1389.53s]  maybe partly childish,
[1389.53s -> 1391.53s]  allow you to try a little.
[1396.83s -> 1398.83s]  The game is very simple.
[1398.83s -> 1400.83s]  We will now show four pictures.
[1400.83s -> 1402.83s]  Each of these pictures has street graffiti
[1402.83s -> 1404.83s]  and some fragments of these graffiti
[1404.83s -> 1406.83s]  are closed.
[1406.83s -> 1408.83s]  And you have to guess
[1408.83s -> 1410.83s]  what is hidden there.
[1410.83s -> 1412.83s]  So, attention!
[1412.83s -> 1414.83s]  What is this gentleman?
[1414.83s -> 1416.83s]  This is, as it were,
[1416.83s -> 1418.83s]  St. Petersburg
[1418.83s -> 1420.83s]  and most likely a fan
[1420.83s -> 1422.83s]  of the football club Denis.
[1422.83s -> 1424.83s]  Probably this is ...
[1424.91s -> 1426.91s]  I'm not a big football fan
[1426.91s -> 1428.91s]  and not a specialist,
[1428.91s -> 1430.91s]  but I think it's Boyarsky.
[1430.91s -> 1432.91s]  Maybe I saw this picture.
[1432.91s -> 1434.91s]  Yes.
[1434.91s -> 1436.91s]  I think it's Boyarsky. Great.
[1436.91s -> 1438.91s]  Do you know the artist?
[1438.91s -> 1440.91s]  I do not remember.
[1440.91s -> 1442.91s]  There are several such teams in St. Petersburg
[1442.91s -> 1444.91s]  who specialize in such portrait stories.
[1444.91s -> 1446.91s]  So, one more
[1446.91s -> 1448.91s]  street drawing.
[1448.91s -> 1450.91s]  I know this guy.
[1450.91s -> 1452.91s]  There is actually a hint
[1452.99s -> 1454.99s]  that the artist's signature
[1454.99s -> 1456.99s]  had to be encrypted.
[1456.99s -> 1458.99s]  This is my good friend
[1458.99s -> 1460.99s]  Slava Paterka.
[1460.99s -> 1462.99s]  He has a series of works
[1462.99s -> 1464.99s]  from his childhood in front of the TV.
[1464.99s -> 1466.99s]  And this is an image
[1466.99s -> 1468.99s]  of the Brigade series
[1468.99s -> 1470.99s]  and the combined Ninja Turtles.
[1470.99s -> 1472.99s]  Slava had to come to Nizhny
[1472.99s -> 1474.99s]  one day and just wanted
[1474.99s -> 1476.99s]  to do one of the works for this series.
[1476.99s -> 1478.99s]  It's useless, Nikita,
[1478.99s -> 1480.99s]  to even hint at something.
[1481.07s -> 1483.07s]  Maybe it will be more complicated
[1483.07s -> 1485.07s]  here.
[1485.07s -> 1487.07s]  I would like to.
[1487.07s -> 1489.07s]  Well, I think I've seen this work too.
[1489.07s -> 1491.07s]  I think it's an image
[1491.07s -> 1495.21s]  of Mona Lisa.
[1495.21s -> 1497.21s]  And what about the artist
[1497.21s -> 1499.21s]  Pavel Kas?
[1499.21s -> 1501.21s]  An amazing thing is
[1501.21s -> 1503.21s]  that street art is so relevant
[1503.21s -> 1505.21s]  as itself, and when you write
[1505.21s -> 1507.21s]  poems and fill them with some metaphors
[1507.21s -> 1509.21s]  a little more complicated than
[1509.21s -> 1511.21s]  a white birch under the window,
[1511.29s -> 1513.29s]  that's why.
[1513.29s -> 1515.29s]  This is also a real poem,
[1515.29s -> 1517.29s]  everything is fine.
[1517.29s -> 1519.29s]  Here is Uncle Misha Shifutinsky.
[1519.29s -> 1521.29s]  Here I find it difficult to answer.
[1521.29s -> 1523.29s]  3rd of September?
[1523.29s -> 1525.29s]  How?
[1525.29s -> 1527.29s]  I will use the hint.
[1527.29s -> 1529.29s]  No,
[1529.29s -> 1531.29s]  I don't know.
[1531.29s -> 1533.29s]  I don't know, I haven't seen it.
[1533.29s -> 1535.29s]  Do you think
[1535.29s -> 1537.29s]  it says 3rd of September?
[1537.29s -> 1539.29s]  Maybe
[1539.37s -> 1541.37s]  with numbers.
[1541.37s -> 1543.37s]  Well, guys,
[1543.37s -> 1545.37s]  your team is reinforced
[1545.37s -> 1547.37s]  by Olya.
[1547.37s -> 1549.37s]  Very good.
[1549.37s -> 1551.37s]  Well done.
[1551.37s -> 1553.37s]  Thank you very much, Olya Strava,
[1553.37s -> 1555.37s]  for the hint.
[1555.37s -> 1557.37s]  In fact, she herself was involved in the game.
[1557.37s -> 1559.37s]  Maybe it's not the best thing
[1559.37s -> 1561.37s]  to meet Uncle Misha Shifutinsky
[1561.37s -> 1563.37s]  in the street all the time,
[1563.37s -> 1565.37s]  but in any case, it's better than
[1565.37s -> 1567.37s]  some gray, dirty wall.
[1567.45s -> 1569.45s]  Olya,
[1569.45s -> 1571.45s]  summarize it somehow.
[1571.45s -> 1573.45s]  You can do it,
[1573.45s -> 1575.45s]  and I will work on it.
[1575.45s -> 1577.45s]  Life gives us a spirit of battle
[1577.45s -> 1579.45s]  without trying to protect ourselves.
[1579.45s -> 1581.45s]  Rather than
[1581.45s -> 1583.45s]  hit the wall with our heads,
[1583.45s -> 1585.45s]  it's better to paint this wall.
[1585.45s -> 1587.45s]  We have just
[1587.45s -> 1589.45s]  ordered it together.
[1589.45s -> 1591.45s]  While our guests
[1591.45s -> 1593.45s]  are resting in the bar,
[1593.45s -> 1595.45s]  I will announce the next guests
[1595.53s -> 1597.53s]  in their name.
[1597.53s -> 1599.53s]  They seem to
[1599.53s -> 1601.53s]  claim to be
[1601.53s -> 1603.53s]  Roscosmos.
[1603.53s -> 1605.53s]  On their logo,
[1605.53s -> 1607.53s]  an alien is depicted,
[1607.53s -> 1609.53s]  but they are not from RenTV.
[1609.53s -> 1611.53s]  Meet the talented hooligans
[1611.53s -> 1613.53s]  from Cosmos, if we count
[1613.53s -> 1615.53s]  Penza Cosmos, German,
[1615.53s -> 1617.53s]  Nikolai and Gleb.
[1617.53s -> 1619.53s]  The group of cosmonauts!
[1619.53s -> 1626.04s]  Hello, friends.
[1626.04s -> 1628.04s]  What's going on
[1628.12s -> 1630.12s]  at home?
[1630.12s -> 1632.12s]  Are you having fun?
[1632.12s -> 1634.12s]  Yes, we are.
[1634.12s -> 1636.12s]  It's beautiful in Penza.
[1636.12s -> 1638.12s]  Let's bring some street art festival
[1638.12s -> 1640.12s]  to Penza.
[1640.12s -> 1642.12s]  We will draw cosmonauts
[1642.12s -> 1644.12s]  who are not on the stage.
[1644.12s -> 1646.12s]  Let's start.
[1646.12s -> 1648.12s]  Girls, boys,
[1648.12s -> 1650.12s]  as well as their parents are waiting.
[1669.42s -> 1671.42s]  You're the best.
[1671.42s -> 1673.42s]  You're the best.
[1673.42s -> 1675.42s]  You're the best.
[1675.42s -> 1677.42s]  Let them call you.
[1677.42s -> 1679.42s]  You're the best.
[1679.42s -> 1681.42s]  I want to
[1681.42s -> 1683.42s]  tell you
[1683.42s -> 1685.42s]  that I'm
[1685.42s -> 1687.42s]  with you
[1687.42s -> 1689.42s]  somewhere higher.
[1689.42s -> 1691.42s]  On the floor
[1691.42s -> 1695.82s]  I lost
[1695.82s -> 1697.82s]  and found
[1697.82s -> 1701.32s]  you.
[1701.32s -> 1714.24s]  I'm gonna find it
[1714.24s -> 1716.24s]  And I'm always talking about friendship
[1716.24s -> 1720.24s]  Zorin and Zorin learned it from him
[1720.24s -> 1722.24s]  And now I'm just gonna shut up
[1722.24s -> 1724.24s]  I'm gonna find you
[1724.24s -> 1732.19s]  And I'm gonna take you to the place of the stars
[1732.19s -> 1742.00s]  And I'm gonna take you somewhere higher
[1742.00s -> 1749.42s]  I'm gonna find the lost tree
[1749.42s -> 1768.93s]  And I'm gonna take you
[1821.95s -> 1823.95s]  A masonic conspiracy, we think
[1823.95s -> 1827.95s]  Let's take our hands and pray to our idol
[1827.95s -> 1829.95s]  Dmitry
[1829.95s -> 1831.95s]  Yuri Vazha
[1831.95s -> 1833.95s]  Yes, Robert
[1833.95s -> 1835.95s]  Yuri Vazha
[1835.95s -> 1837.95s]  Vazha
[1837.95s -> 1839.95s]  Let's sing the second song, right?
[1839.95s -> 1841.95s]  Yes, let's sing
[1841.95s -> 1865.42s]  The rain
[1865.42s -> 1871.74s]  I didn't take a shower
[1871.74s -> 1873.74s]  I didn't believe in myself
[1873.74s -> 1875.74s]  You have the most ordinary eyes
[1875.74s -> 1877.74s]  Your little ring is falling apart
[1877.74s -> 1879.74s]  But I don't care
[1879.74s -> 1881.74s]  And I have a very deep soul
[1881.74s -> 1883.74s]  And we're better
[1883.74s -> 1887.74s]  But the jar with the jackets
[1887.74s -> 1889.74s]  Is already full
[1889.74s -> 1891.74s]  The jar with the jackets
[1891.74s -> 1893.74s]  Is already full
[1893.74s -> 1895.74s]  Only two of us
[1895.74s -> 1897.74s]  The jar with the jackets
[1897.74s -> 1899.74s]  Is already full
[1899.74s -> 1901.74s]  Only two of us
[1901.74s -> 1903.74s]  The jar with the jackets
[1903.74s -> 1905.74s]  Only two of us
[1905.74s -> 1907.74s]  The rain started to fall
[1907.74s -> 1909.74s]  And it poured into my head
[1909.74s -> 1911.74s]  I thought I remembered that
[1911.74s -> 1913.74s]  The rain started to fall
[1913.74s -> 1915.74s]  And it poured into my head
[1915.74s -> 1917.74s]  I remembered that
[1917.74s -> 1919.74s]  The rain started to fall
[1919.74s -> 1921.74s]  And what did you say?
[1921.74s -> 1923.74s]  I took you
[1923.74s -> 1925.74s]  I lied to myself
[1925.74s -> 1927.74s]  But I didn't believe in myself
[1927.74s -> 1929.74s]  You have the most ordinary eyes
[1929.74s -> 1931.74s]  Your little ring is falling apart
[1931.74s -> 1933.74s]  But I don't care
[1933.74s -> 1935.74s]  And I have a very deep soul
[1935.74s -> 1937.74s]  And we're better
[1937.74s -> 1939.74s]  But the jar with the jackets
[1939.74s -> 1941.74s]  Is already full
[1941.74s -> 1943.74s]  The jar with the jackets
[1943.74s -> 1945.74s]  Is already full
[1945.74s -> 1947.74s]  Only two of us
[1947.74s -> 1949.74s]  The jar with the jackets
[1949.74s -> 1951.74s]  Is already full
[1951.74s -> 1953.74s]  The jar with the jackets
[1953.74s -> 1955.74s]  Is already full
[1955.74s -> 1957.74s]  Only two of us
[1957.74s -> 1959.74s]  The jar with the jackets
[1959.74s -> 1987.95s]  Is already full
[2007.95s -> 2009.95s]  We haven't received the call yet
[2009.95s -> 2011.95s]  Yury Laza, call us
[2011.95s -> 2013.95s]  Hello
[2013.95s -> 2015.95s]  Is this the band Ksansky?
[2015.95s -> 2017.95s]  Hello, this is Laza
[2017.95s -> 2019.95s]  Good evening, Laza
[2019.95s -> 2021.95s]  Gofit
[2023.95s -> 2027.95s]  On a small plateau
[2027.95s -> 2029.95s]  Take the phone, please
[2031.95s -> 2033.95s]  German, hello
[2033.95s -> 2035.95s]  What is your third song?
[2035.95s -> 2037.95s]  Our third song is
[2037.95s -> 2039.95s]  TPM
[2039.95s -> 2041.95s]  TPM?
[2041.95s -> 2043.95s]  The third song is
[2043.95s -> 2045.95s]  Well done, Laza
[2045.95s -> 2047.95s]  Well done, Laza
[2047.95s -> 2049.95s]  Come on, come on
[2049.95s -> 2051.95s]  I'll turn it on, I want to record it
[2051.95s -> 2053.95s]  Come on, come on
[2053.95s -> 2070.12s]  So they taught me
[2070.12s -> 2072.12s]  To kiss you
[2072.12s -> 2074.12s]  To kiss you
[2074.12s -> 2076.12s]  To kiss you
[2076.12s -> 2078.12s]  To kiss you
[2078.12s -> 2080.12s]  I love you
[2080.12s -> 2082.12s]  I love you
[2082.12s -> 2084.12s]  Thank you for teaching me
[2084.12s -> 2086.12s]  To laugh so cool
[2086.12s -> 2088.12s]  To laugh so cool
[2088.12s -> 2090.12s]  Three years, three years
[2090.12s -> 2092.12s]  We don't laugh at each other
[2092.12s -> 2094.12s]  Suddenly I lost the microphone
[2094.12s -> 2096.12s]  But I remember
[2096.12s -> 2098.12s]  You smell like mint
[2098.12s -> 2100.12s]  Fingers smudged
[2100.12s -> 2102.12s]  I'm always waiting for you
[2102.12s -> 2104.12s]  Between fourth and fifth
[2104.12s -> 2106.12s]  You smell like mint
[2106.12s -> 2108.12s]  Fingers smudged
[2108.12s -> 2110.12s]  We don't laugh at each other
[2110.12s -> 2112.12s]  Suddenly I lost the microphone
[2112.12s -> 2114.12s]  But I remember
[2114.12s -> 2116.12s]  You smell like mint
[2116.12s -> 2118.12s]  Fingers smudged
[2118.12s -> 2120.12s]  I'm always waiting for you
[2120.12s -> 2122.12s]  Between fourth and fifth
[2122.12s -> 2124.12s]  You smell like mint
[2124.12s -> 2126.12s]  Fingers smudged
[2126.12s -> 2128.12s]  We don't laugh at each other
[2128.12s -> 2130.12s]  Suddenly I lost the microphone
[2130.12s -> 2132.12s]  But I remember
[2132.12s -> 2134.12s]  You smell like mint
[2134.12s -> 2138.46s]  And these clothes
[2138.46s -> 2140.46s]  Some costumer came
[2140.46s -> 2142.46s]  Some artist
[2142.46s -> 2144.46s]  Or you decided it yourself?
[2144.46s -> 2146.46s]  Yes, we decided it ourselves
[2146.46s -> 2148.46s]  Interesting
[2148.46s -> 2150.46s]  It shines
[2150.46s -> 2152.46s]  Cool, we can clap
[2152.46s -> 2154.46s]  Not all, but almost
[2154.46s -> 2156.46s]  Yes, it shines
[2156.46s -> 2158.46s]  Who shines, everything is visible
[2158.46s -> 2160.46s]  In peas
[2160.46s -> 2162.46s]  Can you buy it somewhere?
[2162.46s -> 2164.46s]  Of course
[2164.46s -> 2166.46s]  We can film it
[2166.46s -> 2168.46s]  In hair and makeup
[2168.46s -> 2170.46s]  We can film everything
[2170.46s -> 2172.46s]  Ok, we agree, let's listen to the fourth song
[2172.46s -> 2176.54s]  Let's clap, dear friends
[2209.20s -> 2210.96s]  A naked photo
[2210.96s -> 2213.12s]  A naked photo
[2213.12s -> 2215.12s]  A naked photo
[2215.12s -> 2217.12s]  Close to you
[2217.12s -> 2219.12s]  A naked photo
[2219.12s -> 2221.12s]  A naked photo
[2221.12s -> 2223.12s]  I'm short for you
[2223.12s -> 2225.12s]  My thoughts are short
[2225.12s -> 2227.12s]  And for you it's not working without me
[2227.12s -> 2229.12s]  At this line
[2229.12s -> 2231.12s]  Stupid lines
[2231.12s -> 2233.12s]  And you're dumb
[2233.12s -> 2235.12s]  Because you're not mine
[2235.12s -> 2237.12s]  I'm short for you
[2237.12s -> 2243.12s]  My music, in short, does not come from me
[2243.12s -> 2247.12s]  But these lines, stupid lines
[2247.12s -> 2251.12s]  And you think that you are not mine
[2251.12s -> 2254.12s]  How are you?
[2254.12s -> 2257.12s]  How are you?
[2257.12s -> 2261.12s]  How are you?
[2261.12s -> 2265.12s]  How are you?
[2265.12s -> 2268.12s]  Million, million, million, million
[2268.12s -> 2271.12s]  Red blood, veins, veins, veins, veins
[2271.12s -> 2274.12s]  In front of us, a parallelized world underfoot
[2274.12s -> 2278.12s]  High, high, shot, shot, shot
[2278.12s -> 2282.12s]  We are with you, we are under fire
[2282.12s -> 2286.12s]  Blue lightnings, go, go, naked, naked
[2286.12s -> 2289.12s]  Naked, naked, naked, naked, naked
[2289.12s -> 2291.12s]  Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
[2291.12s -> 2294.12s]  We are with you, we are with you, we are with you, we are with you
[2294.12s -> 2296.12s]  You're with me in my life
[2296.12s -> 2302.12s]  My music, in short, does not come from me
[2302.12s -> 2306.12s]  But these lines, stupid lines
[2306.12s -> 2310.12s]  And you think that you are not mine
[2310.12s -> 2317.12s]  My music, in short, does not come from me
[2317.12s -> 2321.12s]  But these lines, stupid lines
[2321.12s -> 2325.12s]  And you're stupid, thinking that you're not mine
[2325.12s -> 2327.12s]  How are you?
[2327.12s -> 2328.12s]  Like this
[2328.12s -> 2330.12s]  And how are you?
[2330.12s -> 2331.12s]  Like this
[2331.12s -> 2332.12s]  How are you?
[2332.12s -> 2334.12s]  And how are you?
[2334.12s -> 2336.12s]  Like this
[2336.12s -> 2338.12s]  And how are you?
[2338.12s -> 2340.12s]  Like this
[2340.12s -> 2342.12s]  It's hard to breathe quickly
[2342.12s -> 2344.12s]  The most annoying thing is again
[2344.12s -> 2346.12s]  Millions of thoughts, stop trying
[2346.12s -> 2348.12s]  Cold, cold, cold, cold
[2348.12s -> 2349.12s]  Give me talk
[2349.12s -> 2350.12s]  Fools, give me talk
[2350.12s -> 2352.12s]  On the phone, on the phone
[2352.12s -> 2354.12s]  Big, big, blue cake
[2354.12s -> 2355.12s]  Insane
[2355.12s -> 2357.12s]  And how are you?
[2357.12s -> 2359.12s]  How are you?
[2359.12s -> 2361.12s]  And how are you?
[2361.12s -> 2363.12s]  How are you?
[2363.12s -> 2365.12s]  And how are you?
[2365.12s -> 2367.12s]  How are you?
[2367.12s -> 2369.12s]  And how are you?
[2369.12s -> 2371.12s]  And you're good
[2371.12s -> 2373.12s]  My mind is good
[2373.12s -> 2375.12s]  And you're good
[2375.12s -> 2377.12s]  It doesn't work without me
[2377.12s -> 2379.12s]  Insane lines
[2379.12s -> 2381.12s]  Dry lines
[2381.12s -> 2383.12s]  And you're stupid
[2383.12s -> 2385.12s]  Thinking that you're not mine
[2391.12s -> 2393.12s]  Thinking that you're not mine
[2422.40s -> 2424.40s]  We'll meet in the summer
[2424.40s -> 2426.40s]  Thank you
[2426.40s -> 2428.40s]  So excited
[2428.40s -> 2430.40s]  We were the most beautiful
[2430.40s -> 2432.40s]  We'll meet in the snow
[2432.40s -> 2434.40s]  The most beautiful
[2434.40s -> 2438.92s]  The most beautiful
[2438.92s -> 2442.68s]  We'll leave behind
[2442.68s -> 2443.68s]  So many
[2443.68s -> 2444.68s]  So many
[2444.68s -> 2445.68s]  So many
[2445.68s -> 2447.68s]  Millions of quarrels
[2447.68s -> 2448.68s]  We got it
[2448.68s -> 2449.68s]  Let's just
[2449.68s -> 2450.68s]  Leave behind
[2450.68s -> 2451.68s]  So many
[2451.68s -> 2452.68s]  So many
[2452.68s -> 2453.68s]  So many
[2453.68s -> 2455.68s]  Millions of quarrels
[2455.68s -> 2456.68s]  We don't care
[2456.68s -> 2458.68s]  We'll meet in the snow
[2458.68s -> 2460.68s]  The most beautiful
[2460.68s -> 2462.68s]  The most beautiful
[2463.68s -> 2464.68s]  The most beautiful
[2465.68s -> 2467.68s]  In the snow
[2468.68s -> 2471.70s]  It was beautiful
[2472.70s -> 2473.70s]  We'll meet in the snow
[2473.70s -> 2474.70s]  In the snow
[2474.70s -> 2475.70s]  It was beautiful
[2476.70s -> 2477.70s]  The most beautiful
[2478.70s -> 2479.70s]  In the snow
[2481.70s -> 2486.10s]  We'll meet in the snow
[2488.10s -> 2490.10s]  We'll meet in the snow
[2492.10s -> 2493.10s]  We'll meet in the snow
[2560.43s -> 2562.43s]  Silent night
[2563.43s -> 2565.43s]  The snow is melting
[2565.83s -> 2567.83s]  You're a snowman I'm a snowman
[2567.83s -> 2571.43s]  You're stupid, I'm stupid
[2571.43s -> 2573.43s]  The snow is melting
[2573.43s -> 2575.43s]  You're a snowman, I'm a snowman
[2575.43s -> 2579.43s]  You're stupid, I'm stupid
[2579.43s -> 2581.43s]  I spread the snow
[2583.43s -> 2585.43s]  The most beautiful
[2585.43s -> 2587.43s]  The snow is melting
[2587.43s -> 2589.43s]  I spread the snow
[2589.43s -> 2592.43s]  The guys are playing, you can sing to him.
[2592.43s -> 2596.43s]  Here, on the wall, the cosmonaut artist drew.
[2596.43s -> 2598.43s]  And you can fly with him.
[2598.43s -> 2601.43s]  It turns out that we live in the world of miracles,
[2601.43s -> 2604.43s]  you just have to get involved in it for real.
[2604.43s -> 2607.43s]  Raise your head, turn on your imagination,
[2607.43s -> 2610.43s]  and also become a hero, or a song, or street art,
[2610.43s -> 2613.43s]  or some other completely new phenomenon,
[2613.43s -> 2617.43s]  which you yourself will soon discover in yourself.
[2617.43s -> 2619.43s]  This was the Art Mechanics program.
[2619.43s -> 2623.43s]  I want to give each of you one poem,
[2623.43s -> 2627.43s]  which I also dreamed of the day before this shooting.
[2627.43s -> 2629.43s]  Here you go.
[2636.60s -> 2640.04s]  It sounds like this.
[2640.04s -> 2642.04s]  The lips kiss without thinking.
[2642.04s -> 2644.04s]  It's raining as if the train is coming.
[2644.04s -> 2646.04s]  This is my love for the wind.
[2646.04s -> 2648.04s]  Waiting for the thread with a needle.
[2648.04s -> 2651.04s]  The apple of the train in the box.
[2651.04s -> 2653.04s]  August appeared like a dream.
[2653.04s -> 2655.04s]  To sew to the present
[2655.04s -> 2658.04s]  the future buttons of the bell.
[2658.04s -> 2660.04s]  Near the Moscow station
[2660.04s -> 2662.04s]  the trains smoke in the fog.
[2662.04s -> 2664.04s]  As if from the film Tarkovsky
[2664.04s -> 2666.04s]  water is flowing from the sky.
[2666.04s -> 2668.04s]  Drink it, but don't sleep.
[2668.04s -> 2670.04s]  The sky is so close already.
[2670.04s -> 2672.04s]  The childhood in my soul is spinning
[2672.04s -> 2674.04s]  with bicycle spokes.
[2674.04s -> 2676.04s]  Autumn is my inevitable.
[2676.04s -> 2678.04s]  The sky will open its eyes.
[2678.04s -> 2680.04s]  On the left is the gentle clock.
[2680.04s -> 2682.04s]  On the right is the railway station.
[2682.04s -> 2684.04s]  The girls are crying over the boys.
[2684.04s -> 2686.04s]  The apples are all in the bruises.
